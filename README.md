Restuarant Picker
Create three categories, with ten restuarants in each category. Allow the user to generate a random restuarant. Alternatively, allow the user to pick a category before generating a random eatery

Peer reviewed by Harrison Busby: "The code looks pretty good, just a couple of minor errors. When you are asked to pick or to randomize, if you input a response that isnt one of those two, the program kills itself. Other than that the data validation on the other responses were unbreakable(at least to my knowledge). Overall good code, just a couple of things to fix and then its great! Good job Maddie! :)
